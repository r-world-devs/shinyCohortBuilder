# shinyCohortBuilder (development version)

* Fixed error showing up when user deactivates filter with more than one value set.
* Added `gui_args` argument that can be set to `filter`. 
  The argument stores list of arguments passed to input controllers.

* Implement bugs related to `multi_discrete` filter (https://github.com/r-world-devs/shinyCohortBuilder/issues/9).
* `onUnload` hook implemented to clear custom package hooks (https://github.com/r-world-devs/shinyCohortBuilder/issues/21).
